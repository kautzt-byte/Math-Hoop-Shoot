Arcade Free-Throw (Math Game) - Concepts

Gameplay loop (current)
- Earn tickets by answering a math question (button: "Earn Tickets (Question)").
- Each ticket = 30 seconds of shooting time (tickets convert into one timed session).
- During a session:
  - Aim phase: the ball moves left/right; press Space to lock position.
  - Power phase: power oscillates; press Space to shoot.
  - Shots score 2 points, or 3 points if taken far enough from the hoop.
- Successful shots can drop boxes:
  - Base box drop chance is 5%.
  - 3-pointers get a small bonus chance.
- When time runs out, show a session summary + list of earned boxes.
- Boxes can be opened:
  - Regular: open immediately.
  - Fancy upgrade: answer a question first, then open with better rarity odds.
- Boxes unlock ball skins; unlocked/equipped skins persist via localStorage.

Question system (current)
- Questions load from `data/questions.json` with a fallback set in `main.js` if the file is missing/unreadable.
- Supports `mcq` (multiple choice) and `short` (typed) question types.
- Currently configured to use a single question from the pool (see `CONFIG.singleQuestionMode` / `CONFIG.singleQuestionIndex` in `main.js`).
